## Introduction

Welcome to **getpublickey** - the ultimate solution for obtaining the public key of TLS-enabled HTTP servers with unparalleled simplicity and security. In an age where data breaches and cyberattacks are ever-present threats, **getpublickey** empowers you to secure your digital assets by knowing your server's public key.

## What is getpublickey?

**getpublickey** is a Python web service with a RESTful API that allows you to retrieve the public key used by a TLS-enabled HTTP server. It is designed with a security-first approach, using only Python's built-in libraries to minimize attack surfaces, making it resilient against potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

  - **Simplicity:** No external libraries required â€“ just Python's built-in capabilities.
  - **Security:** Minimized attack surfaces for robust protection.
  - **Scalability:** Seamlessly integrate with Docker and Kubernetes for easy deployment.
  - **Reliability:** Rigorously tested on KIND Kubernetes clusters and renowned HTTPS servers.

## Getting Started

To start using **getpublickey**, follow these simple steps:

### Clone the Repository

To get started with getpublickey, the first step is to clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubev2v/getpublickey.git
cd getpublickey
```

### Configure Your Environment

Before you run the server, ensure your environment is properly set up:

Install Python: getpublickey requires Python to run. If you haven't already, [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Optional Libraries for Linting:

Install `isort` for imports sorting:

```bash
pip install isort
```

Install `black` for code formatting:

```bash
pip install black
```

#### Optional Tools for Containerization:

Install `podman` if you wish to build and use container images. [Follow the installation guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) specific to your operating system.

#### Optional Tools for Cluster Deployment:

Set up a `kind` Kubernetes cluster if you want to run the server in a cluster environment. Detailed instructions can be [found on the kind GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind).

### Run the Server

#### To run the getpublickey server:

```bash
python ./src/getpublickey.py
```

#### Optional Flags:

  --port: Specify the port for the server to listen to. (Default is 8443)

```bash
python ./src/getpublickey.py --port 8080
```

  --listen: Set the listen address. (Default is 0.0.0.0)

```bash
python ./src/getpublickey.py --listen 192.168.1.100
```

  --tls-key and --tls-cert: Point to files containing the server PEM certs. (Default are key.pem and cert.pem)

```bash
python ./src/getpublickey.py --tls-key /path/to/yourkey.pem --tls-cert /path/to/yourcert.pem
```

#### Generate Local Self-Signed Certificates for Testing:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -days 365 -nodes
```

### Access the API

With the server up and running, you can access the API to retrieve public keys. Use the `curl` CLI utility:

```bash
curl -k -G https://127.0.0.1:8443/ --data 'url=example.com:443/boards'
```

  Replace the `url` parameter value with the desired server's URL from which you want to retrieve the public key.


### Run Using Container

#### Generating Self-Signed Certificates for Testing

Before running the container, if you need self-signed certificates for testing, you can generate them using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/tls.key -out certs/tls.crt -days 365 -nodes
```

This will create a certs directory with two files: `tls.key` (the private key) and `tls.crt` (the certificate).

#### Building the Container Image with Podman

To build the container image using Podman:

```bash
podman build -t quay.io/kubev2v/getpublickey:latest .
```

This command builds the container and tags it as `quay.io/kubev2v/getpublickey:latest`.

#### Running the Container Locally

Once the image is built, you can run it locally using the following command:

```bash
podman run -it -p 8443:8443 -v $(pwd)/certs:/var/run/secrets/getpublickey-serving-cert:Z quay.io/kubev2v/getpublickey:latest
```

This command:

  - Maps port 8443 on the host to port 8443 in the container.
  - Mounts the `certs` directory (with the self-signed certificates) to `/var/run/secrets/getpublickey-serving-cert` in the container.
  - Uses the `:Z` option to ensure the mounted directory has the correct SELinux label.
  - Runs the container image `quay.io/kubev2v/getpublickey:latest`.

After executing the command, your service should be accessible at `https://localhost:8443`.

### Running on a Kubernetes Cluster

To deploy and run the `getpublickey` server on a Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps below:

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `kubectl` installed and properly configured to communicate with your cluster.
You need permissions to create new `namespaces` and `deployments` on the cluster.

#### Deployment

  - Log in to the cluster:
Ensure you're logged into your Kubernetes cluster with the necessary permissions.

  - Deploy the Application:
Apply the provided deployment configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ci/deployment.yaml
```

This command will perform the following actions:

  - Create the `konveyor-forklift` namespace.
  - Create a secret containing example PEM certification files.
  - Deploy the `getpublickey` server.
  - Create a service to expose the `getpublickey` server inside the cluster.

#### Verify Deployment:

After running the command, ensure that the deployment is successful and the pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n konveyor-forklift
```

#### Accessing the Service

The `getpublickey` service is exposed within the cluster under the `konveyor-forklift` namespace on port 8443.

To access the service from your local machine, you can use `kubectl` port-forward:

##### Port Forwarding:

Run the following command to forward port 8443 from the service to port 8443 on your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/getpublickey 8443:8443 -n konveyor-forklift
```

##### Access the Service:

With the port forwarding in place, you can access the service on your local machine by navigating to:

```arduino
https://localhost:8443/url=www.google.com
```
