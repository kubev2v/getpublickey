# Humoristic Intent and Security Implications

Please note that 'getpublickey' is a humoristic creation meant for satirical purposes and not a legitimate security tool. Blindly obtaining a public key from an unverified server is not a best practice in cybersecurity. It's essential to verify the authenticity of a server's public key to ensure secure communication and prevent potential attacks. Always consult with cybersecurity professionals and utilize recognized, reputable tools and practices when dealing with the security of digital assets. The simplicity of the one-liner provided below demonstrates the program's playful nature rather than its practicality in real-world security scenarios.

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -text
```
